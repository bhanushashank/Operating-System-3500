Explanation :-

1)Deleted page allocation from the system call(sys_sbrk) implementation, which is present at location kernel/sysproc.c.

2)The sbrk(n) system call grows the processâ€™s memory size by n bytes, and then returns the start of the newly allocated region (i.e., the old size).

3)We have deleted the memory allocation but increased the process size.

4)Inserted the function in uvmunmap function present in kernel/vm.c.

5) To make this modification, growproc() should not be called when n >= 0. Instead, only myproc->size += n should be done, and old size should be returned. When n < 0, i.e. for deallocation, 

   growproc should be used as usual.

6) Added print function for printing virtual address and pte in function uvmunmap.
