INPUT :- one argument as string 
OUTPUT :- printing the argument using system call (echo_simple)
 
Explanation :-

1) Create a new system call named echo_simple which takes string as the argument.

2) value is stored in register and calls ECALL instruction which switches from user mode to kernel mode.

3) echo_simple is invoked by sys_call function.

4) echo_simple takes argument from register with help (argint)function.

5) print the string via stdout in kernel mode.
