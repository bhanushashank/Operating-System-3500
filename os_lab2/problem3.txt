OUTPUT :- Function for tracing  the system calls(using trace system call)
 
Explanation :-

1) Create a new system call named trace which takes mask as the argument.

2) Mask contains bits specifies which system calls to be traced. If ith bit is set then system call associated with i number needs to be traced.

3) value is stored in register and calls ECALL instruction which switches from user mode to kernel mode.

3) Modified the structure of proc by adding additional integer which stores mask for trace system call specificly.

4) syscall function invokes trace system call.

5) Trace function takes argument with (argint)function which takes value from register and stores the value in struct created for the process.

6) If number associated with system call is x and if xth bit is set in mask then prints the id of process, system call name and return value of function.

7) else process the remaining commands.

8) Since syscall function is invoked for every system call,syscall function checks the above condition everytime and prints when condition is satisified.
