INPUT :- takes one or more arguments as string 
OUTPUT :- prints the arguments using system call (echo_kernel) from kernel mode.
 
Explanation :-

1) Create a new system call named echo_kernel which takes (number of strings present and array of strings) as the arguments.

2) values are stored in register and calls ECALL instruction which switches from user mode to kernel mode.

3) echo_kernel is invoked by sys_call function.

4) echo_kernel takes starting address of strings array with help of (fetchaddr)function and number of strings with (argint)function .

5) prints the array of strings from kernel mode.
